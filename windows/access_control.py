NTFS ACE Flags: access control entry header flags
    OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE: Noncontainer child objects inherit 
                        the ACE as an effective ACE.
    CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE: Child objects that are containers, 
                           such as directories, inherit the ACE as 
                           an effective ACE. The inherited ACE is 
                           inheritable unless the 
                           NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE bit flag is also set.
    NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE: If the ACE is inherited by a child object, 
                              the system clears the OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE and 
                              CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flags in the inherited ACE. 
                              This prevents the ACE from being inherited by 
                              subsequent generations of objects.
    INHERIT_ONLY_ACE: Indicates an inherit-only ACE, which does not control access 
                      to the object to which it is attached. If this flag is not set, 
                      the ACE is an effective ACE which controls access to the 
                      object to which it is attached.
    SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG: Used with system-audit ACEs in a SACL to generate 
                                audit messages for successful access attempts.
    FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG: Used with system-audit ACEs in a system access control 
                            list (SACL) to generate audit messages for failed access attempts.
